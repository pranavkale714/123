Data Mining
Analyze the various related attributes like location, pH value from which alkalinity of the soil is determined. Along with it, percentage of nutrients like Nitrogen (N),
 Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) 
use of third-party applications like APIs for weather and temperature, type of soil, nutrient value of the soil in that region, amount of rainfall in the region, soil composition can be determined.
ecommendations about required fertilizer ratio based on atmospheric and soil parameters of the land which enhance to increase the crop yield and increase farmer revenue.
An ideal soil would be made up of 45% minerals (sand, clay, silt), 5 %
organic (plant and animal) material, 25% air and 25% water. The mineral
portion would be loam (20 – 30% clay, 30 – 50% silt and 30 – 50% sand).
It would be crumbly, relatively dark in color, smell earthy and rich, team
with microorganisms and earthworms, have plenty of nutrients and a pH
between 6.5 and 7.5.\\
